#+title: Why Emacs
#+author: Chaise Conn

* My Background
- Started using *Vim* in high school
- I love keyboard-driven interfaces
- I love customizing my tools
- I started using *Emacs* 1 year ago
* Why do we need to talk about Emacs?
** Editor Market Share
From the 2019 StackOverflow developer survey:
[[file:marketshare.png]]
** Why no love for Emacs?
- Never heard of Emacs?
  + Initially released in *1976*
- Think it's just a text editor?
- Tried Emacs before, but couldn't figure it out?
* What is Emacs?

It's a *programmable*, *text-oriented* user-interface

** Emacs is an IDE!
- Versatile key bindings
- Window splits
- Terminal
- Syntax highlighting
- Syntax checking / linting
- Completion
- Project search & tree
- Git interface
  + Status
  + Committing
  + Log
  + Push / Pull
- Breakpoint Debugging (/experimental/)

** Emacs is a REPL!
- [[file:~/.config/doom/config.el][Configured]] in *Emacs Lisp*

- Every action is a *function*
  + You can execute functions using keybinds, or by calling them directly

- Every function is *self-documenting*

- Has it's own *package manager*

*** Example
#+begin_src elisp :results none
(defun projectile-find-readme ()
  "Open the README for the current project"
  (interactive)
  (let ((fpaths (append
                 (file-expand-wildcards (projectile-expand-root "*.org"))
                 (file-expand-wildcards (projectile-expand-root "*.md")))))
    (if (and (not (seq-empty-p fpaths))
             (file-exists-p (car fpaths)))
        (find-file (car fpaths))
      (message "README doesn't exist"))))

(map! :leader "p /" #'projectile-find-readme)
#+end_src
** Emacs is an operating system!
- File browser
  + PDF reader
  + Image viewer
- Email client
- Personal agenda
- RSS feed reader
- Personal finance
- Literate programming
- Tiling window manager

* How do I get started?
** First startup

** Tips
- It helps to already be familiar with *Vim*
- Keep the manual page handy

* Conclusion
